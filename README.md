This is a small app that can be used on a traveling app or company site.
It shows two lists one represents the inventory of a passenger's luggage and the selected items in that luggage.

The program allows you to add or remove items from the selected list.

At the top, there is a select button to select a traveling company and each company has a maximum number of KG they allow per person.

After adding the items, one can see the summary of the selected items in a column called backpack.
